# Golang Examples

To run an example, run `go run <exampledirectory>/<example_file_name>.go`

For example, if you want to run the example in [context/cancellation.go](context/cancellation.go), run:

```bash
go run context/cancellation.go
```

Make sure you're in the project root directory when you run the command.
